Making Meshes for OpenFOAM with Gmsh, Part 3: Preparing a 2D Simulation

All code can be found at: https://github.com/lordvon/OpenFOAM_Tutorials/tree/master/GmshBasic3

DESCRIPTION:
Here we will use the 'cavity' tutorial case, but replace the blockMesh-made mesh (the OpenFOAM built-in default) with a Gmsh mesh. The commands used in the tutorial can be found in 'makemesh.sh'.

OUTLINE:
Make the cavity mesh in Gmsh.
Convert the mesh with the command-line OpenFOAM mesh conversion utility.
Modify the boundary conditions so that the case works appropriately.
